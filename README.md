ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m Laiba, a passionate beginner in the world of full-stack development. 
Currently pursuing my Bachelor of Business Information Technology (BBIT), I am excited to bridge the gap between technology and business.

ðŸ’» My journey into coding began recently, and I am diving deep into both front-end and back-end technologies. I enjoy creating interactive and user-friendly web applications, and Iâ€™m constantly exploring new tools and frameworks to enhance my skills.

ðŸ“š As I learn, Iâ€™m focused on building a solid foundation in programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, while also getting familiar with databases and server-side technologies. I believe that a strong understanding of both sides is essential for any full-stack developer.

ðŸŒ± I am committed to continuous learning and improvement. I love collaborating with others and sharing knowledge, so feel free to reach out if you have tips or resources to share!

âœ¨ Join me on my journey as I work on projects and strive to become a proficient full-stack developer. Check out my repositories to see what Iâ€™ve been working on!
